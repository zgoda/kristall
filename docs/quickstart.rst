Quickstart
==========

Kristall requires Python 3.7 or newer to work. Make sure it's installed and
you can create virtualenvs with it.

Installation
------------

The most straightforward way is to use ``pip`` and install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    /usr/bin/python3.7 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip wheel
    pip install -U kristall

Once installed you may want to look at examples.
